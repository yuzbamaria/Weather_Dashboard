# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This is the solution for the challenge from EdX bootcamp, Week 8, Day 4.
During Week 8 at the bootcamp, I learnt DOM, Vanilla JS, local storage and my task was to apply the skills I got and create a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. 
This app runs in the browser, and featurea dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

## User Story 
- AS A coding boot camp student
- I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
- SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
The criteria I need to take into account are the following:

- A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
  - Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  - When answer is clicked, the next question appears.
  - If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock.
- The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
  - When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score.
